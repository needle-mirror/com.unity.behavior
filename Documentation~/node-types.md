# Behavior graph node types

The logic flow of the behavior graph begins at the start node at the top. You can then add further nodes to develop and expand your behavior graph.

The following tables provide information on the different types of nodes available in Unity Behavior along with their description.

## Action node types

To use the **Action** nodes, select **Add** > **Action**.

| Translate | Translates the target's position by a specific amount. |

## Events node types

| Node | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| Start On Event Message | Starts the subgraph after receiving an event message.<br>You can change how the node responds to events using different modes:<br> * `Default`: Processes a message only if the node is idle (no child node is running). Ignores any messages that arrive while busy.<br> * `Restart`: When a message is received, stops all running child nodes and restarts execution from this node.<br> * `Once`: Processes only the first message received, then permanently stops listening to the event channel.<br> * `Queue`: The node stores all received messages in a queue. When the node becomes idle (no child node is running), it processes one message from the queue, then waits until idle again before processing the next queued message. |
| On Start | This is the root of the behavior graph. You can use multiple **On Start** nodes in your graph.|
| Send Event Message | Sends an event message on the assigned channel. |
| Wait for Event Message | Use this node when you want the game character to wait to receive an event message on the assigned channel. |

## Flow node types

| Node | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| Create new Modifier | Creates a new modifier.<br> To use this node, select **Add** > **Flow** > **Create new Modifier**.<br>Modifiers affect how their connected subgraphs are run. <br>For example, a repeat modifier causes its branch to perform its operation more than once. For more information, refer to [Create a custom node](create-custom-node.md).|
| Create new Sequencing | Use this node to create a new sequencing node. To use this node, select **Add** > **Flow** > **Create New Sequencing**.<br>Sequencing nodes control how their connected branches flow. They control how sequences run and define the conditions for a sequence's completion. For more information, refer to [Create a custom node](create-custom-node.md). |
| **Abort** | To use the **Conditional** options, select **Add** > **Flow** > **Abort**. |
| Abort | Aborts the branch when the assigned conditions are true. |
| Restart | Restarts the branch when the assigned conditions are true. |
| **Conditional** | To use the **Conditional** options, select **Add** > **Flow** > **Conditional**. |
| Conditional Branch | Selects a branch based on whether the condition evaluates to true or false. |
| Switch | Branches off based on the `Enumeration` value. |
| **Parallel Execution** | To use the **Parallel Execution** options, select **Add** > **Flow** > **Parallel Execution**. |
| Run In Parallel | Runs all the branches simultaneously. You can set different execution modes in this node to handle parallel branches. |
| Wait For All | Activates a child when all parents have started this node. It can't restart until the child's subgraph has ended. |
| Wait For Any | Activates a child when any parent starts this node. It can't restart until the child's subgraph has ended. |
| **Cooldown** | Imposes a mandatory wait time between iterations to regulate action frequency. |
| **Inverter** | Inverts the result of the child action. A value of success becomes failure and a value of failure becomes success. |
| **Random** | Runs a random branch. |
| **Repeat** | Repeats the operation of a node. You can set different execution modes that define how and when the repeated task executes.|
| **Sequence** | Runs branches in order until one fails or all succeed. |
| **Succeeder** | Forces success for the child node. These nodes are useful in cases where you want to process a branch of a tree where a failure is expected or anticipated, without interrupting the processing of the sequence to which that branch belongs. |
| **Time Out** | Terminates the execution of its branch after a specified number of seconds. |
| **Try In Order** | Runs branches in order until one succeeds. |

## Subgraphs node types

Unity Behavior supports subgraphs through the Run Subgraph node. This node provides two options: static or dynamic, depending on the assigned subgraph variable.

The static option embeds the subgraph directly into the behavior graph, so you can set its **Blackboard** variables directly through the **Inspector**. The dynamic option allows changing the assigned **Blackboard** through the linked Subgraph variable but restricts **Blackboard** variables access to a shared **Blackboard Asset** used as an interface.

To add a Run Subgraph node, follow these steps:

1. Right-click in the behavior graph editor and select **Add** > **Subgraphs** > **Run Subgraph**.
1. In the **Inspector**, select the **Subgraph** link icon.
1. To use a static subgraph, select the **Assets** tab and then select a behavior graph from the list to assign it to the node.

   To use a dynamic subgraph, select the **Variable** tab and assign a **Blackboard** variable to dynamically reference the subgraph.

| Node | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| Run Subgraph | Runs the assigned subgraph and return the graph's final status. This node embeds the subgraph statically into the current graph, so you can override the Blackboard Variables (BBVs) within the subgraph. Use this node when you want to modularize a feature that always uses the same set of data. |
| Run Subgraph Dynamically | This node dynamically assigns a subgraph using `BlackboardVariable<Subgraph>`. Unlike the static Run Subgraph node, this node doesn't embed the subgraph into the current graph, as the assigned `BlackboardVariable<Subgraph>` can change at runtime. As a result, the subgraph’s Blackboard isn't directly accessible. To work around this limitation, assign a Blackboard asset to act as an interface and enable data exchange between the current graph and the dynamically assigned subgraph at runtime. |

## Sticky note

Use the **Sticky Note** node to add a sticky note to the behavior graph. To add a **Sticky Note** to your behavior graph, follow these steps:

1. Right-click an empty area of the Unity Behavior graph editor.
2. Click **Add** from the context menu.
3. Select **Sticky Note**.

This adds a **Sticky Note** to your behavior graph, allowing you to annotate it as needed.
