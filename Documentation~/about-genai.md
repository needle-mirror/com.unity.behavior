# Create a behavior graph with Unity Behavior's generative AI

The Unity Behavior's generative artificial intelligence (AI) feature lets you create node logic or behavior graph structures by using natural language.

Benefits of using Unity Behavior's generative AI:

* **No coding experience needed**: If you need help setting up how the AI might make decisions, generative AI can generate the necessary code for you. For new users, generative AI can generate the behavior graph structure from a description and also generate the code for an action node.
* **Efficiency for experienced coders**: If you're proficient in coding but prefer to save time, use generative AI to write the initial code, allowing you to make modifications as needed. Generative AI can create most of the behavior graph structure, so you don't have to build it manually from scratch. It generates the necessary code, giving you the option to review and make changes as necessary.

> [!NOTE]
> It's free to use Unity Behavior, but you need a Muse subscription to access the generative AI features of the tool.

> Before using the generative AI features, you must [install Muse Common](install-muse-common.md). This package is required to create behavior graphs and its nodes using generative AI.

Explore the generative AI capabilities of Unity Behavior and start creating your behavior graphs with this innovative functionality.
